# RISC-V-Computer-design
This project is a computer designed by us, based on the principles of the Risc_V computer, which consists of an assembler that converts the code you enter in the software into a binary file, and in the simulator, after pressing the Load button, it opens that file, extracts its information, and shows all the RAM and registers. Next, with the Clock button, you can view the entire system performance at any time, and with the Run button, you can view it continuously.  
In this project, in a folder called build and inside it in a folder called Output, there is a project installation file, using which you can install the software on your system and use it.  
In the doc folder, you can see information about the computer and its design, and in the src folder, all the code related to the project is located
This project is written on the Qt programming environment using the C++ programming language.  
Finally, we hope that this project will be useful and enjoyable for you.
